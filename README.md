# 🎮 Metal Slug (C++ with Raylib – Procedural Edition)

This project is a **fully playable 2D run-and-gun game**, inspired by the classic **Metal Slug** series — built entirely using **C++ and raylib**, but written in a **procedural programming style** (without OOP).  
Despite not using classes or inheritance, this version delivers a **complete gameplay experience** with movement, shooting, enemy AI, collisions, menus, and difficulty modes.

## 🚀 Overview

This version was my first major step into game development with **raylib**.  
The focus was on mastering **game logic, rendering, and event handling** using only **Programming Fundamentals (PF concepts)** — such as structs, loops, and functions.  

It’s a complete game on its own, not a prototype.  
Every gameplay element — from player control to level progression — is handled procedurally and efficiently.
